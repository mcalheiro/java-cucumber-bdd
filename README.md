# BDD-Cucumber

This repository contains Cucumber practice. I created some features written in Gherkin and implemented the tests for a webpage that simulates an auction house. For this project I set the the features language to Portuguese.

## Tests implemented
- Unit tests
- E2E tests

## Dependencies used
- JUnity 5
- Cucumber 6
- Selenium

## Usage
In order to run the tests, it is required that you have installed java jdk8 and download SprintToolSuite4 (or Eclipse IDE).
Then, in Sprint (or Eclipse), import the ```pom.xml``` file and wait for setup to complete. Then, right click on ```/leilao/src/test/java/br/com/alura/leilao/acceptance/LeilaoCucumberRunner.java``` and run as JUnit test.

This is a reproduction of the code from [BDD with Cucumber from Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/bdd-cucumber-java).
